        "- Multithreading\n",
        "  - Multithreading involves running multiple threads within a single process. A thread is the smallest unit of execution that can be scheduled by an operating system. In multithreading, all threads share the same memory space and resources of their parent process. This shared memory model makes it easy for threads to communicate with each other, as they can directly access common variables and data structures.\n",
        "  - Because threads share resources, multithreading has relatively low overhead compared to multiprocessing. Threads are lightweight and quicker to create and switch between. This makes multithreading particularly effective for I/O-bound tasks — operations that spend a lot of time waiting for input/output operations like reading files, network communication, or user input. In such cases, while one thread waits for I/O, other threads can continue executing, improving overall program responsiveness.\n",
        "  - However, Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts the execution of multiple threads in a Python process to one thread at a time, which means that multithreading in Python does not achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks. This limitation means multithreading is less effective for tasks that require heavy computation\n",
        "- Multiprocessing\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing, on the other hand, involves running multiple processes simultaneously. A process is an independent execution unit with its own memory space and system resources. Unlike threads, processes do not share memory by default, which means each process runs in complete isolation from others.\n",
        "  - Because each process has its own Python interpreter and memory, multiprocessing sidesteps the GIL limitation, enabling true parallel execution on multiple CPU cores. This makes multiprocessing ideal for CPU-bound tasks that require intensive computation, such as mathematical calculations, data processing, or image rendering.\n",
        "  - However, this isolation comes at a cost. Processes are heavier than threads, requiring more memory and time to create and manage. Communication between processes is more complex and usually involves inter-process communication mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory"
